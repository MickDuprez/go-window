## Handling basic window events

The code in this folder continues on from the previous code and demonstrates
most of the event handling methods you're likely to need.

There were a few anomolies as documented in the code but I think this is mainly
to do with the OS you are using.

The paint.Paint event needs a lot more investigation but it's early days still
and we're likely to work out what we need to refresh the screen view in the
next section/s.

As mentioned on the main page of this repo, things are not obvious to the new Go
coder coming from other environments/frameworks. Maybe it's just how it's
documented but it really isn't obvious how all the different pieces fit together.
